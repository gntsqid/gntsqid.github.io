/* lets get started on some boxes
   as you can see below, we need to add the following:
        - padding: the distance between boxes in a container
        - border: the line around a single box
        - flex: (items only) 
        - note: containers only)

flex is shorthand for one of three options:
flex: 1 -> flex-grow:1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0
This is like saying flex: 1 1 0
The more grow we have, well, the larger percentage of space the item will take

Let's put the new flex knowledge into practice to make the middle one larger
Note: This controls the width at this point
Note: flex-basis sets the initial size, auto sets it to 250 px width

/* we can also control the direction of flex (the default is "row"
flex-direction: column;
this is attached to the container portion above

the problem though is it needs flex-basis to be auto instead of 0, else it collapses
Note: doing a column also requires I stop using the "height" in the item and instead need it in the container

/*------
- Alignment -
We can arrange items with specific sizes

The boxes don't have to uniformly fill the space
